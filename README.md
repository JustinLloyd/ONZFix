About
=====
A command-line utility useful to game developers working with the Nintendo 
Gameboy and Gameboy Color consoles. This utility is used to dump ROM header 
information to tell you the type of ROM it is, and to modify some of the 
header bytes so that actual Gameboy console could load the ROM from a flash
cart.

This code was originally developed somewhere between 1996 and 1999 and is
getting on to be ~15 years old as of today (October, 2012). I am releasing it 
here for historical reasons.
